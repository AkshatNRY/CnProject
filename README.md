Tool to capture the number of received packets that were fragmented.


This Project is related to design a tool to capture how many received packets that were fragmented and needed to be assembled at the network layer, what were their ids, flag and offsets.

When a host sends an IP packet onto the network, it cannot be larger than the maximum size supported by that local network. This size is determined by the networkâ€™s data link and IP Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) which are usually the same. We will be studying this topic and understand how they are fragmented and what difference it shows for WAN with respect to their ids, flags and offset
